# Credits

Halal Scanner would not be possible without the contributions of the following projects and data sources.  We thank the maintainers and communities behind these resources.

## Open Data & APIs

* **[Open Food Facts](https://openfoodfacts.org/)** – Community‑driven database of food products worldwide.  Licensed under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).  We fetch product ingredient lists and barcodes for the scanner.
* **Public halal education websites and certifier guidelines** – Many of our ingredient and E‑number statuses are based on public articles and guidelines from halal certification bodies.  Citations to these sources are included in the YAML data files.
